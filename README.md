## ‚ôàÔ∏è Biography

My strength is the neuroscience twist in my analytics expertise. I‚Äôm a digital professional with profound understanding on novel data analytics and data tools. Furthermore, the engineering-psychology foundation ensures understanding possibilities and caveats of data analytics and statistical biases. 

My background in academia has provided a wide outlook over digital health data with over ten years experience on personalized healthcare. The experience in science has also yielded excellent capabilities in international collaboration, strong proficiency for independent work, and organising and managing projects. 

My experience in cutting edge R&D teams has provided an extensive and practical competence in current data tools, methods, and technologies. Moreover, my endeavour in scale up business environment has provided an excellent position to learn agile methods and participate in product development and implementation of modern architectures. Working in a small company, constantly redefining goals has increased perseverance but yet resilient approach.
