## ‚ôàÔ∏è Biography

My unique combination of neuroscience expertise and analytics skill set positions me at the forefront of the evolving field of decision science.  This combination ensures a deep understanding of novel data analytics and tools, with a particular focus on how cognitive and statistical biases can influence decision-making processes.

As a data professional, I possess a deep comprehension of the latest in data analytics and tools, reflecting the holistic, decision-centric focus that characterizes decision science. My background in engineering and psychology enriches my approach, allowing me to evaluate and apply various methodologies effectively.

In academia, my focus on digital health and risk management over the past decade has broadened my perspective. This experience has not only sharpened my capabilities in international collaboration and independent project management but also in driving projects that require a multifaceted understanding of data and human behaviour.

I have been involved in a variety of research projects, focusing on topics like sleep research, circadian rhythms, psychophysics, executive functions, situational awareness, multimodal perception, burn-out, safety, and risk avoidance. These projects, detailed in the Skills section, reflect my ability to apply analytical techniques in varied contexts, a key aspect of decision science.

My experience in cutting-edge R&D teams has provided me with extensive practical knowledge of current data tools, methods, and technologies. My tenure in fast-paced business environments has honed my agility and adaptability, skills critical for successful decision-making in the ever-evolving data landscape. Working in small, dynamic companies has further cultivated my resilience and ability to thrive amidst constant change.

As an analytical thinker, I value the big-picture perspective that is central to decision science. Identifying what is relevant and focusing on those aspects is crucial. The importance of utilizing state-of-the-art tools in this context cannot be overstated, as they enable the holistic approach to decision-making that is at the heart of decision science.
