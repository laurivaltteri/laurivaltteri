## ‚ôàÔ∏è Biography

My strengths are neuroscience twist in my analytics expertise and experience in talented teams in data science. I‚Äôm a digital professional with profound understanding on novel data analytics and data tools. Furthermore, the engineering-psychology foundation ensures understanding potential and caveats of statistical and cognitive biases.

My background in academia has provided a wide outlook over digital health data with over ten years of experience in personalized health. The experience in science has also yielded excellent capabilities in international collaboration, strong proficiency in independent work, and organising and managing projects. Working in multidisciplinary teams has flourished skills in resolving conflicts and resulted a solution-oriented mindset. Despite the independent attitude, research projects have also thrived behaviour to actively ask for guidance.

I've been involved in multiple applied research and basic research projects with physiological measurements, please see the *Skills* section for modalities. Projects' topics have involved sleep research, circadian rhythms, psychophysics, models of physiological systems, executive functions, situational awareness and multimodal perception, burn-out, and autonomic nervous system responses to emotional-cognitive factors such stress.

My experience in cutting edge R&D teams has provided an extensive practical competence of current data tools, methods, and technologies. Moreover, my endeavour in scale-up business environment has provided an excellent position to gain experience in agile methods and to participate in product development and implementation of modern architectures. Working in a small company, constantly redefining goals has enhanced perseverant but yet resilient mindset.

As an analytic personality, I believe one should always think of the big picture. It is important to be able to identify what is relevant and to focus on that. And I can't emphasize enough the relevance of utilizing state of art tools.
